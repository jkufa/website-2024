# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Features

- **Progress tracking:** Goals are complete once you complete all of its tasks. Goals have a progress bar to indicate the percentage complete.
- **Target dates:** Goals and tasks can both have target dates set. Goals inherit the latest target date of its tasks by default.
- **Goal organization:** Users can re-organize their goals in the sidebar in whatever order theyâ€™d like!
- **Subgoals:** Users can nest goals within goals to really organize things how they see fit.
- **Hotkeys:** press the G key to quickly add a goal, or the T key for a quickly adding a task

More functionality is on the way.
